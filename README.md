# VendingMachineKata
A vending machine created in Java + Spark (backend) and JS + React (Frontend)

I have created an application that simulates a vending machine. The user can add money and buy a product. They wil recieve the correct change and can return their money. A service person can also add new items and money to the machine.

Getting Started

New users need to first pull the code down from github and ensure that they have a text editor/IDE installed

Prerequisites

A text editor/IDE to inspect the code
JDK installed
Node.js installed

Installing
1. Pull the code down off of github using "git clone" in the terminal
2. Open in VendingMachine in your IDE
3. Run Main.java
4. (optional) navigate to localhost:4567/items to see the JSON data
5. Open vending_machine_frontend in a text editor/IDE
6. Type npm install in the terminal to install dependences
7. Type npm start to run the server - localhost:3000 should automatically start in a browser tab

Using the Site
1. Add your money to the machine using the dollar/quarter/nickel/dime buttons. Select an item to buy using the selector buttons. It will appear at the bottom of the screen along with your change. You can also hit the return coins button to get your money back.
2. Click on Service in the header to navigate to /services. Add new items to the machine using the form. A service person can also add coins - type the amount of coins in the input area and press submit to add.
